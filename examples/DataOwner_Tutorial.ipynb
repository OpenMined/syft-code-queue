        "**Always Check:**\n",
        "- ✅ Does the code only compute aggregate statistics?\n",
        "- ✅ Are individual records protected from exposure?\n",
        "- ✅ Is the computational load reasonable?\n",
        "- ✅ Are the dependencies safe and trusted?\n",
        "- ✅ Does the requester have legitimate research needs?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Red Flags:**\n",
        "- ❌ Code that exports raw data\n",
        "- ❌ Individual record access or printing\n",
        "- ❌ Network requests to external servers\n",

        "2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and concurrent job limits\n",
        "3. **Audit Trail**: All approvals/rejections are logged for accountability\n",
        "4. **Communication**: Maintain clear communication with researchers about your policies\n",

        "3. **Assess Risk** → Check against your privacy and security criteria\n",
        "4. **Make Decision** → Approve with reason or reject with feedback\n",
        "5. **Monitor Execution** → Watch job progress and results\n",
        "6. **Provide Results** → Completed job outputs are available to requester\n",

        "### 🤝 Communication with Researchers\n",
        "\n",
        "- Be transparent about your approval criteria\n",

        "- Suggest improvements for resubmission\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Production Use**: Run the server continuously as a daemon\n",
        "- **Monitoring**: Check logs regularly for issues\n",
        "- **Maintenance**: Clean up old completed jobs periodically\n",
